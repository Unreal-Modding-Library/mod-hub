# Mod-Hub
A shared settings window for blueprint mods that want to use it.

## How to use as a mod user
Download ModHub.pak and install into `<GameProjectName>/Content/Paks/LogicMods` ([Unreal Mod Loader](https://github.com/RussellJerome/UnrealModLoader) is required)

## How to use as a mod developer
Download the most recent release of `_ModHub.zip`

Extract the folder `_ModHub` from within this `.zip `into your UE project's `Content` folder. So an example project path should be `<GameProjectName>/Content/_ModHub`

There are 3 interfaces:
* `IHub` - Coontains functions that can be called on the `Mod Hub Manager`. More on that later
* `IHubPageWidget` - The interface to add to every widget blueprint page that you want to add to Mod Hub
* `IHubMod` - The interface to add to the main mod actor of your mod

**Optional:**

4. Right click the event functions and implement them. You can now handle these events.
5. Mod Registered gets called when your mod is registered with Mod Hub. It returns a reference to the Hub.
6. As shown are some of the functions that can be used with the IHub reference.

### Notes
- Do not pack the `_ModHub` folder nor its contents with your mod. A copy already exists with the ModHub itself.
- If you want to view the ModHub source code, you can find it in the `Source` folder. Make sure you don't pack this with your mod.
- There is an example ModHub mod called "Test", if you get stuck.
